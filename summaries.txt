
--EXAMPLE 1---
This Argo data analysis pertains to a single float measurement, providing a snapshot from the ocean.
**Key Observation Details:**
*   **Measurement Date:** The recorded date is July 10, 2025, indicating a future or hypothetical Argo float deployment and data acquisition.
*   **Geographical Location:**
    *   **Latitude:** 19.389048° N
    *   **Longitude:** 63.582901° E
    These coordinates pinpoint the measurement to the **Northern Indian Ocean**, specifically within the **Arabian Sea**, situated west of the Indian subcontinent.
*   **Unlabelled Numerical Value:** The core numerical observation is **36.649834**.

**Statistical Interpretation of the Unlabelled Value (36.649834) in Argo Context:**

Given the lack of a specific parameter label, the value is evaluated against common Argo sensor outputs:

1.  **Salinity (Practical Salinity Units - PSU):** Interpreting the value as 36.65 PSU is highly plausible for surface or near-surface waters in the Arabian Sea. This region is known for moderate to high evaporation, which can lead to salinities in this range.
2.  **Pressure/Depth (Decibars - dbar):** If this represents pressure, 36.65 dbar corresponds to approximately 36.65 meters depth. This would indicate a very shallow measurement, which is a common occurrence for Argo floats during their profiling cycles (e.g., at the start of a descent or end of an ascent near the surface).
3.  **Dissolved Oxygen (e.g., µmol/kg):** A value around 36.65 µmol/kg would represent a relatively low concentration of dissolved oxygen. This is a possibility in certain parts of the Arabian Sea, which are recognized for experiencing Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) at various depths, though this specific value might be more typical for the upper reaches of such zones or shallower waters depending on conditions.
4.  **Temperature (Degrees Celsius - °C):** An interpretation of 36.65 °C is considered **exceptionally high** for open ocean waters, even in tropical regions. While extremely localized or shallow coastal waters might occasionally approach this, for the open Arabian Sea, this would be an extreme outlier and highly unusual for an Argo float measurement.

**Summary:**
This Argo float data point, dated July 10, 2025, from the Arabian Sea, presents an unlabelled numerical value of 36.649834. Based on typical oceanographic parameters observed by Argo floats, the most statistically plausible interpretations for this value are either **salinity (36.65 PSU)** or a **shallow pressure/depth (36.65 dbar)** measurement. While a low dissolved oxygen concentration (36.65 µmol/kg) is also a possibility, a temperature of 36.65 °C would be an extreme and highly improbable observation for the open ocean. Definitive interpretation necessitates the specific parameter label associated with this data point.

**Argo Float Measurement Summary:**
An Argo float recorded a subsurface data point revealing a temperature of approximately **11.14 °C** at a pressure of **965.08 decibars**. This pressure corresponds to an oceanic depth of nearly **965 meters**.
This individual observation provides key insight into the ocean's thermal conditions at significant depth, contributing to the broader understanding of ocean heat content, stratification, and large-scale circulation patterns derived from the Argo network data.

**Ocean Argo Data Analysis Summary:**

The provided SQL query result, a data tuple `(10.523094611450471, 971.2524209537997)`, has been analyzed within the specialized context of Ocean Argo profiling data. This analysis focuses on identifying the most probable oceanographic parameters represented by these numerical values.

**1. Interpretation of Depth/Pressure Parameter:**
The second numerical value, **971.2524209537997**, strongly indicates a measurement of **depth in meters** or **pressure in decibars**. This value aligns perfectly with typical Argo float operational profiles, where measurements are routinely collected at depths nearing 1000 meters, which could represent a parking depth or an intermediate point within a standard 2000-meter vertical profile. The numerical proximity of meters and decibars in oceanographic context further supports this interpretation.

**2. Interpretation of Environmental Parameter:**
Given the inferred depth/pressure, the first numerical value, **10.523094611450471**, is most plausibly an **ocean temperature reading in degrees Celsius**. A temperature of approximately 10.52°C is a highly realistic observation for ocean waters at roughly 971 meters depth, although the precise value would be dependent on the specific ocean basin and water mass characteristics. Through statistical comparison with typical Argo data ranges, this value is less likely to represent:
*   **Salinity**, which generally ranges from 32 to 37 Practical Salinity Units (PSU).
*   **Dissolved Oxygen**, which is typically reported in units such as µmol/kg or ml/L, with magnitudes not directly aligning with 10.5 without specific unit conversion context.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the characteristic structure and typical ranges of Ocean Argo data parameters, this specific data point from the SQL query most probably represents an **ocean temperature of approximately 10.52 degrees Celsius, observed at a depth/pressure of roughly 971.25 meters** within an Argo float's vertical measurement profile.

**Recommendation for Enhanced Oceanographic Contextualization:**
To provide a more definitive and precise oceanographic analysis, the following metadata would be highly valuable for future SQL queries:
*   **Parameter Identification:** Explicit **column names** (e.g., `temperature_celsius`, `pressure_decibars`, `depth_meters`) to unequivocally confirm the measured variables.
*   **Geographical Context:** **Latitude and Longitude** coordinates of the measurement to position the data point within specific oceanographic regions and water masses. 
*   **Temporal Context:** The **date and time** of the observation to assess seasonal variability or specific oceanographic events.
